# Welcome to ifasha

_ifasha_ is a Python library developed by the _Computational Mechanics of Building Materials_ chair at the Institute for Building Material of ETH Zurich. It is used to postprocess data from numerical simulations with a regular time-independent discretization (*e.g.*, finite-element method or boundary-integral methods).
