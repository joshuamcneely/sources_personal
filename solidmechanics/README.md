# solidmechanics

This is a python package for solid mechanics. It includes elasticity and fracture mechanics.

## get started

Import the library at the beginning of your script with

`import solidmechanics as sm`

and for the lefm subpackage, use

`import solidmechanics.lefm as lefm`

Note: use Python3

## testing

You can test (some of) the solid mechanics and lefm functions, by executing the `./test.sh` script.

## examples

Some examples (even with verification) are provided in the examples foldes. However, they only run if __solidmechanics__ is in the python path.
